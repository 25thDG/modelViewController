# 15-Puzzle Game

## Description
This repository contains the implementation of the classic 15-Puzzle Game, developed as part of my programming course in the second semester. The 15-Puzzle is a sliding puzzle that consists of a 4x4 grid of numbered square tiles in random order, with one tile missing. The objective is to arrange the tiles in numerical order by sliding them into the empty space.

The primary focus of this project is to implement and explore the **Model-View-Controller (MVC)** design pattern in Java. This project was made solely to practice and understand the architecture of the MVC model, with a clear separation between the logic (Model), user interface (View), and the control flow (Controller).
